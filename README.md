### The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search
Founded by MIT scientist George Woltman in 1996, GIMPS is an ongoing distributed computing project that has been actively searching for Mersenne primes. Currently there were 51 Mersenne primes found, of which 17 were found by GIMPS --- they are the largest and latest ones. Dr. Chris Caldwell maintains a web site on the largest known primes, it also has an excellent introduction of different primes.
<p/>
The GIMPS project uses volunteer computational powers with a free program to search for primes. Essentially anyone that has a PC with a decent CPU can start their prime searching. There are cash rewards offered to lucky person who finds a new prime. You could include $3,000 (USD) cash GIMPS Research Discovery Award for each Mersenne prime discovered, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation is offering a $150,000 award to the first person or group to discover a 1,000,000 (one million) digit prime number! You can make history too!

### My Participation
I have three PCs that currently assigned to the following tasks:
