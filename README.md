### Main Problems
**1. Tower Sum (2022.1.19; solved)**
<br/>
Denote the tetration of an integer as ${^{n}a}=a^{a^{a^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$ where $a$ is present $n$ times. Other than $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$, are there more primes in the form $p_n={^{n}2}+{^{n}3}=3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.}}}}}+2^{2^{2^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$?
<br/>
<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
No, the frist three are the only primes in such pattern.
<br/>
For $n=4$, we have $21219553216129$ divides $p_4$.

(Note: this result was first obtained on 2/24/2022 through one month of paid cloud computing which should be credited to the original author, see 
<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/512482114/answer/2319816820?utm_id=0"> Original Answer (in Chinese) </a>.
<br/>
For $n\geq{4}$, we have $34276387$ divides $p_5$, and in general, $4423$ divides $p_6$ or greater. In fact, there might be only finitely many divisors for all $p_n$.

**[Generalized] Mixed Tower Sum (2023.1.19; open)**
<br/>
How many primes are there in the form $p={^{a}2}+{^{b}3}$, where ${a}\neq{b}$, finitely or infinitely many?
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.




**2. $N$ Factorial Sum (2022.10.9; open)** 
<br/>
For any integer $n\geq{1}$, is there always a prime that can be obtained from combinations of addition and subtraction of all elements in the set $\lbrace{1!, 2!, 3!, â€¦, n!}\rbrace$? 
Such as
$p_1={1!}\pm{0!},$
$p_2={2!}\pm{1!},$
$p_3={3!}\pm{2!}\pm{1!},$
$\cdots,$
$p_n=n!\pm(n-1)!\pm(n-2)!\pm(n-3)!\pm\cdot\cdot\cdot\pm{1!}.$
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This statement reamins true for $p_{1}$ to $p_{257}$ and likely to be true for all positive integers. Considering the prime density around $n!$ with such combination shoud be $\frac{2^{n-1}}{nlog(n)}>1$.

**[Generalized] Two Factorial Sum (2022.10.10; partially solved)**
<br/>
For all integers ${n}\geq{k}\geq{1}$, can we always find a prime of form ${n!}\pm{k!}\pm{1!}$? If not, could there be finitely many exceptions? 
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
The answer to the first question is 'no', and the second is 'maybe', these counter examples only appeared at $n=\lbrace{63, 161, 382, 902}\rbrace$ for $n\leq1200$.

**[Generalized] Three Factorial Sum (2022.10.12; open)**
<br/>
For all ${a}\geq{b}\geq{c}\geq{1}$, can we always find a prime of form ${a!}\pm{b!}\pm{c!}\pm{1}$?
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.




**3. Collatz Sequence Sum (2022.10.25; open)**
<br/>
If we randomly assign $\pm$ to all elements of a Collatz sequence, i.e.
$C(1)=1$,
$C(2)=2-1$,
$C(3)=3-10+5+16-8-4-2+1$,
$C(4)=4-2-1$,
$C(5)=5-16+8+4-2+1$,
$C(6)=6+3-10-5+16-8-4+2+1$,
will at least one combination always converge a 0 or 1?  
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.
