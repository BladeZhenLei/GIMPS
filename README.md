### The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search
Founded by MIT scientist George Woltman in 1996, GIMPS is an ongoing distributed computing project that has been actively searching for Mersenne primes. Currently there were 51 Mersenne primes found, of which 17 were found by GIMPS --- the largest and latest ones. Dr. Chris Caldwell maintains a website that has an excellent introduction on different primes and Mersenne Primes.
<p/>
The GIMPS project uses volunteer computational powers with a free program to search for primes. Essentially anyone that has a PC with a decent CPU can start their prime searching, it usually will take weeks to finish checking a new exponent. However, there are cash rewards offered to lucky person who finds a new prime, that include 3,000 (USD) GIMPS Research Discovery Award and the Electronic Frontier Foundation Award of 150,000 (USD) to the first person or group to discover a 1,000,000 digit prime number! You can make history too!

### My Participation (last updated: 4/11/2023)
Currently I have three PCs that are assigned to the following tasks:
<br/>
$M(69635581)$ - **Lucas–Lehmer Test** (Double Checking)
<br/>
$M(69636487)$ - **Lucas–Lehmer Test** (Double Checking)
<br/>
$M(116803187)$ - **Probable Prime Test** (First Check)
