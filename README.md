### The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search
Founded by MIT scientist George Woltman in 1996, GIMPS is an ongoing distributed computing project that has been actively searching for Mersenne primes. Currently there were 51 Mersenne primes found, of which 17 were found by GIMPS --- the largest and latest ones. Dr. Chris Caldwell maintains a website that has an excellent introduction on Mersenne Primes.
<p/>
The GIMPS project uses volunteer computational powers with a free program to search for primes. Essentially, anyone that has a PC with a decent CPU can start their prime hunt, it will usually take weeks to months for checking a new exponent with a specific method if it is relatively small and the computer runs 24/7 at high CPU usage. However, there are cash rewards offered to lucky person who finds a new prime, that include 3,000 (USD) GIMPS Research Discovery Award and 150,000 (USD) Electronic Frontier Foundation Award to the first person or group to discover a 100,000,000 digit prime number! You can make history too! See <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/"> https://www.mersenne.org/ </a> for details.


### My Participation (last updated: 4/11/2023)
Currently I have three PCs that are assigned to the following tasks:
<br/>
$M(69635581)$ - 20,962,399 digits - **Lucas–Lehmer Test** (Double Checking)
<br/>
$M(69636487)$ - 20,962,672 digits - **Lucas–Lehmer Test** (Double Checking)
<br/>
$M(116803187)$ - 35,161,263 digits - **Probable Prime Test** (First Check)
